Let the machine analysis and predict the trend
regression question basicly is the curve filting problem in nature

gradient descent :you have a line, and turn right little, turn right little then finally you could find converge the point perfectly (the error is less than 0.00001), to change the k and b prameter

least square method:  the method to get the error  Sum(points in linear ideal - points in facts) ^ 2  to solve the regression problem

if we find the tangent of the curve, ky = 0, then the error is minimum

learning rate: the frequency of the tangent line rotation speed
                        if too fast->may not fit 
                        manual parameter

if this curve is up down too much, then this curve has multiple local minumum point
